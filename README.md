## 1. Introduction
This is an intuitive and effective Graphical User Interface for controlling an assistive walking exoskeleton for reabilitation. 

The interface is implemented in C++ with the aid of the Qt libraries for the graphics part and the connection to ROS. The main objective of the work was to develop a user-friendly interface so that the physiotherapist can focus on the patient and the effectiveness of the treatment. 

The validation of the interface was conducted through tests on a prototype exoskeleton, demonstrating its effectiveness and ease of use. 

## 2. Fake_exo_pkg
This is just a pkg to simulate the response of ALICE exoskeleton

In order to download the GUI go to main or workspace branch
